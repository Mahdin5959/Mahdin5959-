Hi, I’m Mahdin.

I work with Python and focus on building practical programs that solve simple, real problems. I prefer learning by writing code and improving projects rather than spending too much time on tutorials.

I’m interested in automation, data handling, and API-based applications. My goal is to steadily improve code quality, logic, and problem-solving skills by working on real projects and documenting them properly.

Right now, I’m building Python scripts and small applications such as task managers, data management tools, automation utilities, and API-driven mini projects. 
I use Python for logic and automation, Git and GitHub for version control, and I focus on writing clear, readable code that actually works.

You can explore my repositories to see what I’m building and how I approach problems.
